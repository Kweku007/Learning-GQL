This is where i would be taking notes, documenting what I've learnt!

So far:

About GraphQL
1. Object Type - basically creating the objects in the graph
2. Root Query - the query you would technically use to fetch the objects in the graph (DB)
3. Mutations - Queries you can use to update objects and data in the graph (DB)
4. Resolvers - functions that interact with actual data in queries and Mutations
5. Schema would eventually comprise of the root query and the mutations

MongoDB/Mongoose
1. Design a schema/model of how the data in the DB would look like
2. Connect to the DB using Mongoose
3. Through the model, interact with the DB in the resolvers from the queries and mutations
