This is where i would be taking notes, documenting what I've learnt!

So far:

GQL - Express Youtube Video

About GraphQL Server Side (ExpressJS)

1. Object Type - basically creating the objects in the graph
2. Root Query - the query you would technically use to fetch the objects in the graph (DB)
3. Mutations - Queries you can use to update objects and data in the graph (DB)
4. Resolvers - functions that interact with actual data in queries and Mutations
5. Schema would eventually comprise of the root query and the mutations

MongoDB/Mongoose

1. Design a schema/model of how the data in the DB would look like
2. Connect to the DB using Mongoose
3. Through the model, interact with the DB in the resolvers from the queries and mutations

Client Side

- React App
- Apollo GraphQL Client setup

Creating same queries and mutations which would be called by the client components
